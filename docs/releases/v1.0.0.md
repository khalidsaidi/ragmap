# Ragmap v1.0.0 - Reachability You Can Trust

**Try it:** https://ragmap-api.web.app/browse/

Ragmap is a discovery + trust layer for MCP servers focused on retrieval/RAG. This release solidifies "reachable" as a meaningful signal, adds actionable install output, and introduces freshness-aware querying so results stay trustworthy.

## Highlights
- Added `/rag/top` for smart defaults and fast discovery.
- Added `/rag/install` with actionable config output (supports `streamable-http` and `sse` remotes).
- Added `/rag/stats` with freshness + coverage metrics.
- Reachability now probes both `streamable-http` and `sse` (SSE via short GET + abort/cancel).
- Added `reachableMaxAgeHours` for "reachable recently" filtering.
- Ranking now prefers reachable `streamable-http` first, then fresher checks (when `reachable=true`).
- Scheduled reachability refresh now runs 4x/day.
- Added public freshness watchdog workflow (`monitor-freshness`) with retries/timeouts and exact (seconds-based) threshold checks.

## Breaking changes
- None. All behavior is additive; stricter freshness behavior is opt-in via query param (`reachableMaxAgeHours`).
